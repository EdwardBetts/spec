title: Session
description: |-
  A Session captures the **actual** use of an `AssignedRight` and includes start time, end time, credential, and other relevant data related to an operational transaction. A Session is not used for future activities.

  A `Session` is broken into one or multiple `Segments`.

  `Segments` enable a single `Session` to capture and report changes in `Rate` and `AssignedRight` during a `Session`.
