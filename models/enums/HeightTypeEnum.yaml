title: HeightTypeEnum
description: |-
  List of coded values for height types, as defined in GML.

  * `ellipsoidalHeight`: Value measured vertically above the reference ellipsoid
  * `gravityRelatedHeight`: Height type corresponding a value measured along direction of gravity above the reference geoid i.e. equipotential surface of the
  Earth's gravity field which globally approximates mean sea level.
  * `relativeHeight`: Height type corresponding to value measured vertically above
  the ground level at this point.
enum:
  - ellipsoidalHeight
  - gravityRelatedHeight
  - relativeHeight
