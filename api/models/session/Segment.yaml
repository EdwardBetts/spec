description: |-
  Segments enable a single Session to capture and report changes in Rate and AssignedRight during a Session.
  A Segment can only have one AssignedRight and Rate associated to it.

  A `Segment`...

  * Is associated to a Session.
  * Is associated to an AssignedRight.
  * Is associated to a specific Rate via the AssignedRight.
  * Has a start and end time.
  * Has a credential via the AssignedRight.
  * Is associated to basic financial data.
  * Has version control on the AssignedRight (i.e. a segment starts with one AssignedRight and then is updated to a new AssignedRight at the end of the Segment, replacing the original).
  * Has a Place reference or Space ID.
