        Lists `AssignedRights` and allows filtering by:

        * a combination of `HolderCredential` and `RightSpecification`, to check if a given credential has a given right to park
        * latitude, longitude, radius: to check for `AssignedRights` within a geographic area
        * a `Place`, to retrieve all assigned rights within a parking location
        * a modification instant: to only display changed resources from that point onwards

        Additionally, supports providing a comma-separated list of optional object attributes associated to an `AssignedRight` that should be included in the result set. If unused or left blank, `none` will be assumed.

        Lists `Places` and allows filtering by:

        * `latitude`, `longitude`, `radius`: to check for elements in the `Place` hierarchy within a geographic area
        * a modification instant (`modified_since`): to only display changed resources from that point onwards
        * `layer`: maximum hierarchy element layer desired
        * `type`: types of hierarchy elements
        * `right_type`: types of `RightSpecifications` associated with Place hierarchy elements
        * `structure_type`: types of structure
        * `structure_grade`: grades of structures
        * `name`: name of facilities

        Additionally, supports providing a comma-separated list of optional object attributes associated to a `Place` hierarchy element that should be included in the result set. (see `expand` attribute). If unused or left blank, `none` will be assumed.
