        Lists `AssignedRights` and allows filtering by:

        * a combination of `HolderCredential` and `RightSpecification`, to check if a given credential has a given right to park
        * latitude, longitude, radius: to check for `AssignedRights` within a geographic area
        * a `Place`, to retrieve all assigned rights within a parking location
        * a modification instant: to only display changed resources from that point onwards

        Additionally, supports providing a comma-separated list of optional object attributes associated to an `AssignedRight` that should be included in the result set. If unused or left blank, `none` will be assumed.
